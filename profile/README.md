## ðŸ”¥ Welcome to [FusionState](https://fusionstate.io)

We build the future of distributed data integration. Our mission is to become the industry standard for decoupled data access in event-driven distributed systems, enabling seamless, scalable, and efficient data sharing across teams. We have big plans and welcome any contribution to our mission. FusionState will be developed as Open Source project once we reach the Alpha stage (v0.1).
